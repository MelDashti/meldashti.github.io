A neural network is a network or circuit of biological neurons, or, in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus, a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of biological neurons or an artificial neural network, used for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems.

Below, I have included every assignment I completed for the following two courses:
- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning (4 weeks)
- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow (4 weeks)

# What I learnt


### First Week
Coded a neural network that learned the linear relationship between two variables.


* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/w1-assignment/C1W1_Assignment.ipynb)


### Second Week
Implemented a callback that gives you more control over the training loop for your model.

* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/w2-assignment/C1W2_Assignment.ipynb)

### Third Week
Implemented a convolutional neural network to assist you in the image classification task

* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/w3-assingment/C1W3_Assignment.ipynb)

### Fourth Week
Implemented a CNN to assist you in the classification task for complex images.

* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/w4-assingment/C1W4_Assignment.ipynb)


### Fifth Week
Implemented a convolutional neural network that classifies images of cats and dogs, along with the helper functions needed to pre-process the images.

* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/C2W1_Assignment.ipynb)

Model achieved a max training accuracy of 98.54% and a max validation accuracy of a 82.7%.

### Seventh Week
Implemented a convolutional neural network that leverages a pre-trained network to help you solve the problem of classifying humans from horses.

* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/C2W3_Assignment.ipynb)

Model achieved a max training accuracy of 99.81% and a max validation accuracy of a 100%.

### Eighth Week
Implemented a convolutional neural network that is able to perform multi-class classification tasks

* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/TensorFlowProjects/blob/master/C2W4_Assignment.ipynb)

Model achieved a max training accuracy of 89.23% and a max validation accuracy of a 94.63%.
