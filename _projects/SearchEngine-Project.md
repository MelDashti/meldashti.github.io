# Local Search Engine 
An offline search engine that I built in Java for my Information Retrieval & Web Search course. This Search Engine can Parse, Index, Rank, and finally perform an efficient search for thousands of HTML webpages parsed from XML Files in a few seconds. 
* [Github repo](https://github.com/MelDashti/Search-Engine-Project)  


# Parsing 
XML Files were parsed using Document Builder and the following tags were extracted <HTML> <DOCID> and <URL>
The HTML tags <title> and <body>  were parsed using JSOUP.

# Indexing 
Dictionary and posting list is saved in the following data structure : Map<String, List<String>> index

# Search 
With the help of posting list we perform the search across 10700 html documents


# What I Learnt 

* Built an inverted index
* Importance of ranking in a search engine.
* Techniques to improve speed and efficiency in a search engine.
* Dealt with complications of parsing searchable information from a few cluttered and unorganized HTML web pages.
