## 3D Neural Affordance Highlighter
**Applying AI to localize affordance regions in 3D point clouds using vision-language models.**  

This project extends **neural affordance highlighting** to **3D point clouds**, investigating whether affordance regions can be identified using **CLIP-based textual supervision** without explicit 3D labels. It utilizes **multi-view rendering, differentiable rendering, and neural networks** to enhance segmentation accuracy.
