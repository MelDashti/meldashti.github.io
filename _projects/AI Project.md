# What I learnt

- React.js for building interactive user interfaces. (User Sign Up, Search Feature, View User Details).
- MongoDB a NoSQL database program that was used for saving user information. 
- Node.js for handling database connections and making calls to REST API. 
- Node.js and Express.js for building REST API.
- SASS for further improving website style.


# coded a neural network that learned the linear relationship between two variables.
