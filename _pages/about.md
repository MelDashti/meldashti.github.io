Master’s student in Computer Engineering - AI & Data Science at Politecnico di Torino, with a background in software engineering and a strong focus on AI, machine learning, NLP, LLMs, and computer vision. I enjoy building intelligent systems, optimizing deep learning models, and applying AI to real-world challenges.
I started out as a software engineer, working in Android and web development, but my passion for AI led me to focus on LLMs, deep learning, and multimodal AI. Always excited to explore new ideas and solve complex problems.
Open to industry internships, research roles, and paid thesis opportunities in AI, ML, and software engineering. Let’s connect!
