## About Me

I'm an AI/ML Engineer currently working at **Zirak srl** in Turin, Italy, where I architect and develop production-grade AI systems. I specialize in building real-time transcription pipelines, RAG systems, and LLM-powered applications that solve real-world problems.

Currently pursuing my **Master's thesis** at the **University of Twente** on Hyperbolic Compositionality in Vision-Language Models, while completing my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering (AI & Data Analytics) at **Politecnico di Torino**.

### What I Do

My work focuses on cutting-edge AI technologies:
- **Real-time AI Systems**: Built a meeting platform with <2s latency using WhisperX and Faster-Whisper
- **RAG & Vector Search**: End-to-end pipelines with ChromaDB, semantic search, and cross-encoder reranking
- **LLM Applications**: Agentic workflows with LangGraph, fine-tuning LLaMA models with LoRA/QLoRA
- **Multimodal AI**: Research in vision-language models and hyperbolic embeddings

### Research & Publications

- **Master Thesis** (Ongoing): Hyperbolic Compositionality in Vision-Language Models at University of Twente
- **PROFES 2025**: "Enhancing Software Maintainability through LLM-Assisted Code Refactoring" (Accepted)

### Background

I started as a software engineer working in Android and web development, but my passion for AI led me to specialize in machine learning, NLP, and computer vision. I enjoy the challenge of taking research concepts and turning them into production systems that people can use.
